# 3dPrinter-Image-Converter
This script is supposed to convert image files to a 3d model (.3mf) with colors only at a **selected height**. Default is a credit card format.

# Demo here:
***Link: ***

Output differences: 
**From the outside the output is the same but**:
3mf --> slicers dont automatically add the colors you have to do it manually (Process: -> Objects -> select the colors)
obj --> slicers have the neat color mapping dialog *but* the ignores the color layers you set inside the model (greater print times & waste) 

# Example
You Take an Image like this:
<img width="1549" height="973" alt="Input Example" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7e50af1-1026-49c7-956e-557b9a2a0705" />

Use the demo link to convert it:

(Default is a 0.2 nozzle [recommended], 8 colors [grayscale works great for fewer colors] and a credit card format)
<img width="2554" height="1176" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d238f01-a954-4004-bb72-0b222b561f47" />

Have this printable output:
<img width="1268" height="673" alt="Output Example" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/118cdb7b-b3d5-4834-b459-6cba8b2f8c7d" />
